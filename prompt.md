`plans/active/fix-lsp-features.md` has a description of an issue and a plan of how to debug and hopefully solve it. It also describes test that we are missing. Take the next issue from that plan and implement it. Use tasks to structure your work. Use tmux in combination with `zed` and `peekaboo` to check your progress, along with all other tests and checks we have in place.

Complete when:
- The issues described in `plans/active/fix-lsp-features.md` are resolved.
- You made sure that the language features the `StandaloneAnalysisAPISession` provides work in zed, not just in the tests.
- Output: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>
